# Capability Registry (Source of Truth)

Summary
- Canonical list of capability ids, phases, and surface support status.
- Server and SDK API schemas must align to this registry.
- Implementation status is tracked in the roadmap and gaps list, not here.

Legend
- phase: P1, P2, P3
- surface keys:
  - cli_i: interactive CLI
  - cli_h: headless CLI
  - server: server API (HTTP/SSE + OpenAPI)
  - sdk: SDK surface
  - tui: TUI surface
  - mcp: MCP surface
- status values:
  - supported: implemented and exposed
  - planned: intended support in the listed phase
  - not_applicable: surface-specific capability by design

Rules
- Every capability must appear once with a stable id and version.
- Surface-specific capabilities must still list explicit surface statuses.
- Breaking changes require a version bump and an ADR.
