# Rolling Roadmap

Summary
- Single source for now/next/later decisions and capability coverage across surfaces.
- Lightweight on purpose but exhaustive; detailed task specs remain in `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/`.
- Each actionable item includes references + start/finish criteria so a fresh context can resume fast.

How to use
- Every actionable item includes a confidence tag: `[confirm spec]` or `[needs work]`.
- `[needs work]` means confirm spec or design choice before implementation.
- Now/Next/Later items include refs, ready checklist, and done criteria.
- Coverage map is an index only (no checklists), used to ensure every capability group is tracked.
- Date-stamp moves between Now/Next/Later to preserve intent over time.

Now
- Server OpenAPI spec generation + schema snapshot [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/03_contracts/modules/phase-1/06_server.md`, `docs/04_execution/server.md`, `docs/02_architecture/component_map.md`
  - Ready: pick OpenAPI generator crate; decide schema output path
  - Done: `/openapi.json` served; canonical snapshot in `schemas/`; capability registry alignment checks; validation test in CI
- CLI interactive renderer + approvals/diffs UI surface [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/06_cli.md`, `docs/03_contracts/modules/phase-1/05_cli.md`, `docs/04_execution/cli.md`
  - Ready: event frame schema final; approval UX spec confirmed
  - Done: interactive UI renders streams + approvals/diffs; golden render tests

Next
- Workspace engine: checkpoint + rewind hooks integration in runtime [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/04_workspace_engine.md`, `docs/03_contracts/modules/phase-1/04_workspace_engine.md`
  - Ready: hook points in runtime defined; checkpoint event frames defined
  - Done: runtime integration + rewind behavior tests
- Surface parity matrix + gap list enforcement [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/05_quality/surface-parity.md`, `docs/03_contracts/capability_registry.md`
  - Ready: registry expanded with baseline capabilities and surface support fields
  - Done: parity matrix generated; gap list maintained with approvals; CI gate enforced
- Headless CLI JSON validation [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/03_contracts/modules/phase-1/05_cli.md`, `docs/04_execution/cli.md`
  - Ready: event frame schema stable
  - Done: headless mode validates JSON frames; schema tests added

Later
- TUI surface (`rip-tui`) plan + MVP renderer [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/02_architecture/surfaces.md`, `docs/02_architecture/capability_matrix.md`, `temp/docs/ratatui/notes.md`
  - Ready: confirm TUI stack + input model; define surface-specific capabilities
  - Done: `rip-tui` package skeleton + streaming renderer; golden render tests
- MCP surface (`rip-mcp`) parity adapter [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/02_architecture/surfaces.md`, `docs/02_architecture/capability_matrix.md`
  - Ready: server capability registry expanded; MCP protocol mapping defined
  - Done: MCP server exposes core capabilities + session lifecycle
- Benchmarks: TTFT, parse overhead, tool dispatch, patch throughput, end-to-end loop [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/08_benchmarks.md`, `docs/05_quality/benchmarks.md`
  - Ready: event frames + tool runtime stable
  - Done: CI-gated benchmarks with baseline budgets
- Fixtures: deterministic tool outputs + replayable logs [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/09_fixtures.md`
  - Ready: tool runtime emits deterministic frames
  - Done: fixture repos + replay tests in CI
- SDK surface parity (TypeScript first) [needs work]
  - Refs: `docs/02_architecture/component_map.md`, `docs/02_architecture/capability_matrix.md`
  - Ready: session API + event frames stable
  - Done: TS SDK supports session lifecycle + streaming

Capability coverage map (index)
- Sessions & threads [confirm spec] - Phase 1 core + server + CLI; TUI/SDK parity later.
- Session storage & replay [confirm spec] - Phase 1 event log + snapshots; surfaces consume.
- Context & guidance [needs work] - Phase 2 context compiler + guidance loader.
- Configuration & policy [needs work] - Phase 2 layered config + permission engine.
- Commands & automation [needs work] - Phase 1 in-memory registry; Phase 2 disk-based commands.
- Execution modes [needs work] - Phase 1 interactive/headless + JSONL; Phase 2 RPC/SDK expansion.
- Tools & tooling [confirm spec] - Phase 1 tool runtime; policy integration pending.
- Compaction & summarization [needs work] - Phase 2 compaction engine.
- Policy & steering [needs work] - Phase 3 adaptive budgets + rule engine.
- Extensions & hooks [needs work] - Phase 2 extension registry + hook bus.
- Skills [needs work] - Phase 2 skill loader + commands.
- Subagents [needs work] - Phase 2 subagent manager + budgets.
- Models & providers [needs work] - Phase 1 adapter boundary; multi-provider routing.
- Output styles [needs work] - Phase 2 style registry.
- UI/interaction [needs work] - Phase 2 TUI + interaction affordances.
- Integrations [needs work] - Phase 2 MCP/IDE/LSP.
- Background workers [needs work] - Phase 3.
- Checkpointing & rewind [needs work] - Phase 1 workspace engine integration.
- Security & safety [needs work] - Phase 1 baseline + Phase 3 extended sandboxing.
- Search/index & memory [needs work] - Phase 3.

Doc/impl gaps
- Interactive CLI is specified but not implemented (see `docs/07_tasks/phase-1/06_cli.md`).
- TUI surface is documented but not implemented (`rip-tui`).
- MCP surface is documented but deferred to Phase 2 (`rip-mcp`).
- Server OpenAPI spec generation is required but not implemented.
- Surface parity matrix/gap list not generated from registry.
- Tool runtime not yet integrated into session execution.
- Benchmarks are required by docs but no harness exists.
- Headless CLI currently streams raw SSE messages, not validated JSON frames.

Decisions
- Event frames live in `rip-kernel`; schema documented at `docs/03_contracts/event_frames.md`.
- Phase 1 frame types: `session_started`, `output_text_delta`, `session_ended`, `provider_event`, tool events.
