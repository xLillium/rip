# Capability Baseline (Modern Coding Agents)

Summary
- Capability checklist for modern coding agents.
- Used to ensure architectural coverage across phases.
- Coverage and surface parity are tracked in the capability registry and roadmap.
- Surface-specific items still require explicit support/unsupported declarations.

Sessions & Threads
- Start, continue, and resume sessions from prior state.
- Session tree with branching/forking from any prior point.
- Handoff: move work to a new thread with curated context.
- Reference other threads by ID/URL and extract relevant context.
- Archive threads without deleting history; searchable archive.
- Thread labels/tags and thread map/graph views.
- Thread sharing with visibility levels (private, group, workspace, public).
- Thread search by keyword and by files touched.
- Agents panel for viewing and managing multiple active threads.

Session Storage & Replay
- Append-only session storage with deterministic replay (JSONL or equivalent).
- Tree-structured entries with parent/child links (not just linear history).
- Branch summaries stored when switching branches.
- Compaction entries stored with summaries and cut points, including file tracking.
- Session metadata entries (name, labels, model changes, thinking-level changes).
- Custom entries for extension state; custom message entries that affect context.

Context & Guidance
- Project guidance files loaded automatically by path and subtree.
- Glob-scoped guidance that applies only to matching files.
- System prompt overrides from project or user scope.
- Deterministic context compilation and replayable snapshots.
- File- and thread-referencing in prompts (e.g., @file, @thread).

Configuration & Policy
- Layered settings scopes (managed, user, project, local) with clear precedence.
- Config merging across scopes (non-destructive merges).
- JSON/JSONC config support with schema validation.
- Environment variable overrides for critical settings.

- Override or replace built-in tools with custom implementations.
- Remote tool execution as an optional backend.
- Tool-level permissions and per-tool argument rules.
- Allowed-tools lists for noninteractive runs to auto-approve safe tools.
- Read tools support line ranges for large files.
- LSP tool integration for code intelligence and navigation.

Compaction & Summarization
- Auto-compaction when context exceeds threshold (reserve tokens).
- Manual compaction with optional custom instructions.
- Split-turn handling when a single turn exceeds budget.
- Compaction cut-point rules (avoid splitting tool calls/results).
- Branch summarization when navigating session tree.
- File-operation tracking included in summaries.
- Hook-based custom compaction and custom branch summaries.

Policy & Steering
- Adaptive budget controls (tokens, tool calls, time).
- Runtime rule engine for policy decisions and guardrails.

Extensions & Hooks
- Lifecycle hooks (session start, tool call, agent end, etc.).
- Hooks for permission requests, notification events, and pre-compaction.
- Hook matching rules (tool name, args, regex/path filters).
- Hook outputs can allow/deny/modify actions or inject messages.
- Hook handlers can be commands or prompt-based evaluators.
- Extension API to inject messages, append system prompts, and run commands.
- Persistent extension state stored in session entries.
- UI extension points (status, widgets, dialogs, custom editor).
- Event bus for cross-extension communication.
- Register commands, shortcuts, and flags from extensions.
- Custom tool renderers for tool calls/results.
- Extension error reporting and recovery hooks.
- Extension access to session control (new session, branch, navigate tree).
- Extension access to agent state (idle detection, abort, queue visibility).
- Hook events include permission, user prompt, stop, subagent start/stop, tool failure, and pre-compaction.
- Hook types include command, prompt, and agentic verification.
- Hook timeouts and once-only hooks for scoped components.

Skills
- Skills discovered by `SKILL.md` files in workspace/user scopes.
- On-demand skill loading to avoid context bloat.
- User-invokable skill loading (manual activation over auto-load).
- Skill install/list/remove workflows and filters/ignores.
- Skill commands (`/skill:name`) for explicit activation.
- Skill repositories with scripts, references, and assets.
- Skill metadata for compatibility and allowed tools.
- Skill-defined model overrides, tool limits, and hooks.
- Skill-defined forked context or subagent invocation.

Subagents
- Spawn subagents with independent context windows and tool access.
- Specialized subagents (search, review, analysis) as optional modules.
- Subagent profiles with constrained tools, budgets, or objectives.
- Background/foreground subagent execution with handoff controls.

Integrations
- MCP servers (local/remote) with OAuth support.
